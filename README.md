# :baby: Baby Scroll
 *Let your baby scroll endlessly!*

Babies and toddlers love to swipe around on your phone. I built this page to let them scroll through fun emojis forever - in either direction.

Inspired by Scott Hanselman's [BabySmash!](https://www.hanselman.com/babysmash/) Go check it out if you enjoy this.

Built with Vue.js
